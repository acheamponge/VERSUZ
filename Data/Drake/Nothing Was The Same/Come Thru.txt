[Intro]
Yeah
We had the type of nights where mornin' comes too soon
And nothin' was the same

[Verse 1]
Watch me, goin' out of the way, when I shoulda went home
Only time of the day I get to spend on my own
I was trippin' off how I used to sleep at ya crib
Should drive by right where you live and pick you up on the way
We ain't spoke in so long, prolly put me in the past
I can still get you wet, and I can still make you laugh
You should call into work if that ain't too much to ask
I could pour you up a drink and we can burn somethin'

[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through

[Verse 2]
Yeah, last night I brought DOA to the studio
They already had a stage and a booty pole
It's supposed to be a lot of hard workin' goin' on
But who the fuck can focus with this twerkin' goin' on?
Someone put a order in for a chicken (for a chicken)
Told my girl to order in, I need the kitchen (need the kitchen)
Yeah, they know I got the hookup, they just wait on me to cook up
Baby, I heat up the stove, you do the dishes, ya know?
Rap game, crack game, ain't that different, ya know?
Last album had it boomin' somethin' vicious, ya know?
And ya know I need ya back in my life
Girl, ya know ya got that, know ya got that thing that I like
Girl, you got that thing for real
When I was on a mission to make it
Who used to sleep on the floor with you when you lived in the basement?
Who else got all the things you need at 4am when it's late?
I always pour you up a drink and let you burn somethin'

[Chorus]
Come through, come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through
Know ya got that thang that I like
Know ya, know ya got that thang that I like
Come through, come through, come through
Girl you know we got thangs to do
Girl you know we got thangs to do
So get your ass in that car and come through

[Bridge]
Why has it been so long? Why has it been so long?
Why has it been? Why has it been?

[Outro]
Who you been crying to? Who you been flying to?
Whose bed are you sleeping in? Someone's been hiding you
Where have you been? You deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Rounds tonight oh
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
Come through girl you deserve rounds tonight
