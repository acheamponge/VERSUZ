[Intro: Jhené Aiko]
What's up?
Been a minute since we kicked it, you've been caught up
With them bitches, I don't get it, you're a star, love
You shouldn't have to deal with that
I'd never make you feel like that, 'cause...

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 1: Drake]
Yeah, I needed to hear that shit, I hate when you're submissive
Passive aggressive when we're texting, I feel the distance
I look around the peers that surround me, these niggas tripping
I like when money makes a difference but don't make you different
Started realizing a couple places I could take it
I want to get back to when I was that kid in the basement
I want to take it deeper than money, pussy, vacation
And influence a generation that's lacking in patience
I've been dealing with my dad, speaking of lack of patience
Just me and my old man getting back to basics
We've been talking 'bout the future and time that we wasted
When he put that bottle down, girl that nigga's amazing
Well, fuck it, we had a couple Coronas
We might have rolled a white paper, just something to hold us
We even talked about you and our couple of moments
He said we should hash it out like a couple of grown ups
You a flower child, beautiful child, I'm in your zone
Looking like you came from the 70's on your own
My mother is 66 and her favorite line to hit me with is
Who the fuck wants to be 70 and alone?
You don't even know what you want from love anymore
I search for something I'm missing and disappear when I'm bored
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Verse 2: Drake]
Uh, thinking 'bout Texas, back when Porscha used to work at Treasures
Or further back than that, before I had the Houston leverage
When I got Summer a Michael Kors with my momma's debit
A weak attempt at flexing, I'll never forget it
'Cause that night I played her three songs
Then we got to talking 'bout something we disagreed on
Then she start telling me how I'll never be as big as Trey Songz
Boy was she wrong, that was just negative energy for me to feed off
Now it's therapeutic blowing money in the Galleria
Or Beverly Center Macy's where I discovered Bria
Landmarks of the muses that inspired the music
When I could tell it was sincere without tryna prove it
The one that I needed was Courtney from Hooters on Peachtree
I've always been feeling like she was the piece to complete me
Now she engaged to be married, what's the rush on commitment?
Know we were going through some shit, name a couple that isn't
Remember our talk in the parking lot at the Ritz
Girl I felt like we had it all planned out, I guess I fucked up the vision
Learning the true consequences of my selfish decisions
When you find out how I'm living, I just hope I'm forgiven
It seem like you don't want this love anymore
I'm acting out in the open, it's hard for you to ignore
But girl, what qualities was I looking for before?
Who you settling for? Who better for you than the boy, huh?

[Chorus: Jhené Aiko]
I love me
I love me enough for the both of us
That's why you trust me
I know you been through more than most of us
So what are you?
What are you, what are you so afraid of?
Darling, you
You give but you cannot take love

[Outro: Baka]
Been Baka aka Not Nice from time, G
Been a East Side ting
Scarborough ting from time, G

So I don't know what's wrong with these
Little wasteman out here eh?
