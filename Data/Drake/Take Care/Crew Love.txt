[Verse 1: The Weeknd]
Take your nose off my keyboard
What you bothering me for?
There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fucking sing-along
So, girl, what you singing for?
It's cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
20, keep the bar rolling
Fake ID's in the trash, we going
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a hand full of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowing
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash coming straight from Poland, why? Cause

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving this crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving this crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew

[Verse 2: Drake]
Yeah
Smoking weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know what Harvard gets us
But seeing my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times when I might blow like 50k on a vacation
For all my soldiers just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say your lyrics do shit for me
I told my story, and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for 20
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
Much rather spend it all while I'm breathing
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know

[Chorus: The Weeknd]
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew
Whoa

[Outro: The Weeknd]
Cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowing like a C4
