[Verse 1: Drake]
I like a woman with a future and a past
A little attitude problem all good, it’ll make the shit last
Don’t make it too easy, girl, don’t take it too fast
Yeah, that's it right there
That's it, do it just like that
Only you can do it just like that
And I love it when your hair still
Wet cause you just took a shower
Running on a treadmill and only eating salad
Sound so smart like you graduated college
Like you went to Yale but you probably went to Howard
Knowing you, weekend in Miami trying to study by the pool
Couple things due but you always get it done
Might've been a time when I loved her too
But you take that away and you’ve always been the one
One, I wonder why the moon looks nice, girl
Maybe it’s just right for the night
You said niggas coming on too strong, girl
They want you in their life as a wife
That's why you want to have no sex, why you want to protest
Why you want to fight for your right
Cause you don’t love them boys
Pussy run everything, fuck that noise

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, and all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you’re bad as fuck and you—

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
B-b-b-bet I am
All of them bitches I’m badder than
Mansions in Malibu, Babylon
But I never mention everything I dabble in
And I always ride slow when I’m straddling
And my shit’s so wet you gotta paddle in
Gotta r-r-row, gotta row ya boat
It’s Pink Friday Records and OVO
Done did the pop tour, I’m the realest still
The best legal team so the deals is ill
It’s MAC, OPI, and a fragrance, too
Apparel, I’m dominating every avenue
Cobblestone, good view, little gravel too
Gotta pay for the entourage travel too
Cause I’m fl-fl-fly I'm flying high
Ain't got time to talk, just hi and bye, bitch
But baby, if you ask me to take a break
I’ll give it all away, don’t care what the people say
I’ll be a million, billion, trillion miles away aha
He asked my sign, I said a Sag’
I’m a star: sheriff badge
What's the point if I’m guarding?
Double-D up, hoes: Dolly Parton

[Chorus: Drake]
I know things get hard, but girl, you got it
Girl, you got it, there you go
Can’t you tell by how they looking at you everywhere you go?
Wondering what's on your mind, it must be hard to be that fine
When all these muthafuckas wanna waste your time
It’s just amazing, girl, all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Everything's adding up, you've been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are

[Chorus: Drake]
And I know all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
And I know all I can say is
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you
I’m so I'm so I'm so I'm so I'm so proud of you

[Post-Chorus: Drake]
Everything’s adding up, you’ve been through hell and back
That's why you're bad as fuck and you know you are
