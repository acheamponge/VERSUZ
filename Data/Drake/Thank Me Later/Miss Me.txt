[Verse 1: Drake & Bun B]
I said, "Tell me what's really goin' on"
Drizzy back up in this thing, I'm ready, what's hannenin'?
Gone for surgery but now I'm back again
I'm 'bout my paper like a motherfuckin' scratch-and-win
World Series attitude, champagne bottle life
Nothin' ever changes so tonight is like tomorrow night
I will have a model wife, yo' bitch is as hot as ice
Every time you see me, I look like I hit the lotto twice
Drake, you got 'em, right? Yeah, I got 'em, Bun
I love myself 'cause I swear their life is just not as fun
Neeks got the weed, Hush got a gun
CJ got my credit cards and a lot of ones
Yeah, I'm in the city of the purple Sprite
Someone tell Maliah I'm on fire, she should work tonight
Call up King of Diamonds and tell Chyna it'd be worth the flight
I'll be at my table, stackin' dollars to the perfect height
Work somethin', twerk somethin', basis
She just tryna make it so she right here gettin' naked
I don't judge her, I don't judge her but I could never love her
'Cause to her I'm just a rapper and soon she'll have met another
That's why me and Lil Jaz 'bout to spaz, can you keep up?
I'm just feelin' sorry for whoever gotta sweep up
Yeah, bills everywhere, trill everything
And Drake just stand for Do Right And Kill Everything
I love Nicki Minaj, I told her I'd admit it
I hope one day we get married just to say we fuckin' did it
And girl, I'm fuckin' serious, I'm wit' it if you wit' it
'Cause yo' verses turn me on and yo' pants are mighty fitted
Ugh, damn! I think you caught me in a moment
Like I catch 'em stealin' flows 'cause I swear I never loaned it
And life ain't a rehearsal, the camera's always rollin'
So come and get a portion of this money that we blowin'
'Cause it's on

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
Ooh, shit, motherfucker, God damn
Kickin' bitches out the condo like Pam
Gettin' money every day, I'm a groundhog
'Bout to scoop ya girl up like a ground ball
I walk light so I don't piss the ground off
Man, I swear, my bitches do it 'til they suck the brown off
Ew, that's nasty
Yes, I am Weezy but I ain't asthmatic
James Bond cologne, honey I put on
Make 'em run and tell they friends like a marathon
Voice baritone, haters carry on
Beat the pussy up, call me Larry Holmes
Young Money's Jerry Sloan, I turn every stone
When she masturbate to me, that's how she learn every song
To the women I condone, better write me when I'm gone
No, I'm not that thuggish, not that ruggish but I do pack Bone
Uh, I'm a love machine
And I won't work for nobody but you
It's only me and her 'cause the Bugatti a coupe
It's Blood gang, slime, but I parlay with Snoop
I ain't lyin', I shoot, you don't need signs for proof
Turn you to a vegetable like you lyin' in soup
And when I'm in the booth, bitch, the lion is loose
Man, I got so many styles, I am a group
Ha ha, damn! I'll be gone 'til November
But fuck it, I ain't trippin', I know Drizzy gon' kill 'em
I'm stickin' to the script like lint on denim
Momma said "If the rules ain't bent, don't bend 'em"
Real nigga talkin' – shut the fuck up, ho!
Gotta do it one time for Haiti – what up, Zo?
Weezy F. Baby and the F is for Front Do'
'Cause that's where I brang it
Soo-woo if you bangin', motherfucker!

[Chorus: Drake]
Yeah, girl, it's on
You know what it is when I finally make it home
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
Yeah I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone
And you just tell me what you down for, anything you down for
I know things have changed, know I used to be around more
But you should miss me a little when I'm gone
I just hope that you miss me a little when I'm gone, gone, gone

[Outro: Drake]
Uh, yeah, forever in our hearts
JJ, we love you boy—H-Town!
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I’m gone, I’m gone, when I’m gone
I just hope that you miss me, miss me
Miss me, miss me
Miss me a little when I’m gone
Miss me a little when I’m gone, gone, gone
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa, oh-whoa
