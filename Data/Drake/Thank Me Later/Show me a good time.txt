[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 1]
I live for the nights that I can't remember
With the people that I won't forget
Spending all the money that I just worked my ass off for
Doing things that I won't regret
I've been waiting way too long, long, long, long
Telling everybody that I know we about to be on, on, on, on
I ain't trying to look like I lied to these niggas
That I came up with, that's my team
Never would I let a woman come between
What we doing right now, this our dream
Wu-Tang Clan, niggas want that cream
I'm the Osiris to this shit right now
Go-to guy for the hits right now
Whatever you wanna drink girl, pick right now
If you can't hold your liquor, better quit right now

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)

[Verse 2]
Yeah, uhh
How about you and all your morals
In that outfit that you borrowed?
Make the most out of tonight
And worry bout it all tomorrow
Understand girl, we fam girl
Can't get me right and not do Wayne
Cash Money, Young Money, pop champagne
Presidential suite, girl: Barack Hussein
Tell me can we kick it like Ali Shaheed and Phife Dawg?
People really hate it when a backpack rapper
Get rich and start living that life, dawg
Feels like when you get into that paper, hip hop hates you
They would do it just like I do it if they could
It's in our nature—young and rich and out of control
Out in LA blowing clouds of the killa
I came up in the underground though
So I'mma spend another $10,000 for Dilla
Call me overrated or created or too jaded
Because anyway you put it, bitch, I made it—Yup!

[Pre-Chorus]
How did I end up right here with you?
After all the things that I've been through?
It's been one of those days you try and forget about
Take a shot and let it out, let's get right
Now that I'm here, baby

[Chorus]
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
Show me a good—show me a good
Show me a good time (aw yeah, aw yeah)
