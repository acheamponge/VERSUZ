[Verse]
I should be downtown, whipping on the way to you
You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is it that's got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinion on me
I was only gone for the last few months
But you don't have the time to wait on me

[Chorus]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Chorus]
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
'Cause you don't mean it anyway, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way

[Chorus]
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I could do
And that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're talking down on my name, on purpose, yeah
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
World's, world's, world's famous
World's, world's, world's famous

[Post-Chorus]
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
I've stopped listening to things you say
