[Verse 1]
You know they saying since the bar back on the 'dro, he lackin the flow
And if that ever happen whoa I ain't rapping no more
I'm good with a pina, daq and an o
Gagging and choke like ho put the dick back in your throat
Still packing fo sho
Yeezy Weezy off of the heezy fo sheezy
Cruise with the top off of the 'Ghini
Bars got cheese I got cheddar linguini
That's why I keep the federals scheming
That's why I keep the platinum blinging
Every diamond's like a nice size
I help people with problems look at the bright side
With nice ties on a rise so they sitting me high
And the rims born in '79
Weezy carry the nine Glocks
Slipping they gon have to get six niggas name called carry a pine box
Marry me ma, not
But here's what you can do to me
Give me good brains tutor me
W-E-E-Z-Y Wee

[Hook x4]
They call me Weezy Weezy fo sheezy
Banana clip on the heater
Banana whip on them sneakers
Banana dick going deeper

[Verse 2]
Got a good game honestly so respect the young'n
Got your girl undercover like a detective woman

And the pistols right next to him cousin
I'm a player having sex with dozens
Sex with cousins hoes dissed with husbands

Got so many pictures of Ben Franklin
High top tennis on the car cover of the whole game cold
Fuck it up with me niggas come from all angles
Representing S-Q like the Star Spangled
White tee-fish at Kango
Low top Nikes plus my ho pop Nikes
How exciting we riding in the third lane
Said she like Juvy but prefer Wayne
She can give me head
Call her birdbrain on everything
It's Young Weezy cuz I be golly
My neck more colorful then Nelly, Murph, Ky, Ali
I'm so cold deep
Low seats in the old drop blow reef
Like no cops could fuck with this
Swiftly no tops on the whippy
Cash Money hot Bizzy Lil Wizzy get with me
