Ladies and gentlemen
This one goes out to that little kid that got fried Spam for lunch
I feel for you, I'm with you, I'm with you brother
And this one right here is for that ghetto girl with the bad perm
That just burn baby, burn baby, burn
Pop open a malt liquor
Smoke something until your scalp gets killed

[Hook x2]
Gangstas and pimps
Love lobsters and shrimps
Kool-Aid and chicken
Flashy things and women
All I need
Is Remy and weed
Somebody not afraid
To co-sign for my Escalade

[Lil Wayne]
I'm just pimping
Baby you got a rule for me
Put your mink on and slide in a cool for me
Hey you gotta get high and go low for me
It's Cash Money young money never know money
It's 500 Degreez it's not four buddy
And the dro got me so scummy
And to drum hole a whole hundred
Can I put a whole hundred in your whole tummy
Hehe, man Weezy's a legend
You can tell by the bottom of my sleeve when you see what's in a bezel
And he be on a level that's so terrific
I'm in this bitch hold your pictures
And hold your bitches cuz she gon want a part of me
Cuz she never see the roof of my car with me
And you never see a tooth without a diamond on it
This is game at its finest homie
Peep it

[Baby]
See I was born from a gangsta
Pa gave me a whip
Ran numbers with pimps and I laid down cents
One of a kind Birdman I shine
22's on it?
The bitch ain't mine
I taught her the game ma
I gave it all to her
Weezy Wee my son I give it all to him
[Lil Wayne]
The Birdman junior I'm the son of a stunna

Mannie Fresh
Jazze Phezzy this our summer
500 Degreez got rich off the four
Cadillac slant back cut side elbow
Cadillac smoke dro just me and the ho
Flash from hard times from that coke and dope
Put cars in moms name just to duck white folks
We eat lobster and shrimp
Nigga park that Lambo
I'm a V.I.P. nigga
Pop bottles of Mo
I pray that one day I'll open a better door

[Hook]

[Lil Wayne]
Ain't no mountain high enough
To me for cuz I keep on buying fi-fi stuff
And the Eastside where we pump
It's my part of New Orleans
Bleed for ya I'm the heart of New Orleans
Hear you're fucking with a gangsta foe
Hope you never close your eyes I'll bang your ho
All she need is some guidance I'll tame your ho
It's big pimping over here man yeah man
If she looking for a daddy see the lil man
Weezy Baby, don't fool yourself you need me baby
Easy baby, I'm just trying to keep my bread cheesy baby
Slick when I spit shit right
26-inch got a deep-dish ma
Sweet as mami lips when I'm creeping by
Baby gave me wings just to keep me fly
Weezy I, hell yeah
And I'm rolling with them
