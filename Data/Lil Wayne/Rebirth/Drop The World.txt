[Verse 1: Lil Wayne]
I got ice in my veins, blood in my eyes
Hate in my heart, love in my mind
I seen nights full of pain, days are the same
You keep the sunshine, save me the rain
I search but never find, hurt but never cry
I work and forever try, but I'm cursed, so never mind
And it's worse, but better times seem further and beyond
The top gets higher the more that I climb
The spot gets smaller and I get bigger
Tryin' to get in where I fit in, no room for a nigga
But soon for a nigga it be on, motherfucker
‘Cause all this bullshit done made me strong, motherfucker

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
So I pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Verse 2: Lil Wayne]
I know what they don't wanna tell you
Just hope you're heaven-sent, and you're hell-proof
I walk up in the world and cut the lights off
And confidence is a stain they can't wipe off
My word is my pride
But wisdom is bleak, and that's a word from the wise
Served to survive, murdered and bribed
And when it got too heavy I put my burdens aside

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
So I can pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone

[Bridge: Eminem]
It hurts, but I never show
This pain you'll never know
If only you could see just how lonely and how cold
And frostbit I've become
My back's against the wall
When push come to shove
I just stand up and scream: "Fuck 'em all!"

[Verse 3: Eminem]
Man, it feels like these walls are closin' in
This roof is cavin' in, up it's time to raise it, then
Your days are numbered like pages in
My book of rhymes; got 'em cookin', boy
This crooked mind of mines got 'em all shook
And scared to look in my eyes
I stole that fuckin' clock: I took the time
And I came up from behind and pretty much snuck up
And butt-fucked this game up
Better be careful when you bring my name up
Fuck this fame, that ain't what I came to claim
But the game ain't gonna be the same on the day that I leave it
But I swear, one way or another
I'ma make these fuckin' haters believe it
I swear to God, won't spare the rod
I'm a man of my words, so your fuckin' heads better nod
Or I'ma fuck around in this bitch and roast everybody
Sleep on me, that pillow is where your head'll lie
Permanently, bitch, it's beddy-bye
This world is my Easter egg, yeah, prepare to die!
My head is swole
My confidence is up, this stage is my pedestal
I'm unstoppable, Incredible Hulk
You're trapped in my medicine ball
I could run circles around you so fast your fuckin' head'll spin, dog
I'll split your cabbage and your lettuce and olives, I'll fuckin'—

[Hook: Lil Wayne]
Pick the world up and I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
Bitch, I'ma pick the world up
And I'ma drop it on your fuckin' head
And I could die now, rebirth, motherfucker
Hop up in my spaceship and leave Earth, motherfucker
I'm gone, motherfucker, I'm gone
