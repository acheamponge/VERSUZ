Now where your bar at? I'm tryin' to rent it out
And we so 'bout it 'bout it, now what are you about?

Lights off, mask on
Creep silent, she smiling
He muggin', who cares
'Cause my goons are right here
Like it's nothing to a big dog
And I'm a Great Dane, I wear eight chains
I'm in so much ice, they yell "Skate, Wayne!"
She wanna fuck Weezy, but she wanna rape Wayne
(And I'mma let her)

Bring an umbrella, please bring an umbrella
'Ella, 'ella, 'ella, ayy!
Bitch ain't shit but a ho and a trick
But you know it ain't trickin' if you got it
You know we ain't fuckin' if you not thick
And I'll cool your ass down if you think you're hot shit
So Rolex watch this, I do it, four, five, six

And just like it I'll blow that shit
'Cause bitch I'm the bomb like tick, tick
