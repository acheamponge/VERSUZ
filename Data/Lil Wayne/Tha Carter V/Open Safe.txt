[Intro]
Turn the music up
(Mustard on the beat, ho)

[Verse 1]
Tattoos on my face, nigga (Mm)
Grill shinin' in your face, nigga (Yeah)
Blowin' smoke in your face, nigga (Mm)
Hoes smilin' in my face, nigga
Your ho smilin' in my face, nigga (Hello)
She out of line, she out of place, nigga (Hello)
Everybody know my face, nigga
All eyes on me, get the mace, nigga
Uh, bad bitch with the face glitter
Snoop Dogg, murder was the case, nigga
Yeah, my homie got a open case, nigga
We in this bitch lookin' like a open safe, nigga

[Chorus 1]
Uh, lookin' like an open safe, nigga
We in this bitch lookin' like a open safe, nigga
Yeah, if it's beef, we over-ate, nigga
Bap, bap, bap, bap, it's no debate, nigga
Yeah, there go the bass, nigga
You niggas starve, we let food go to waste, nigga
Choke your punk ass out, neck brace nigga
I do the same shit I learned on sex-tapes with her
New money, call it cake, fresh-baked, nigga
Hungry, bullets eatin' off your chest-plate, nigga
I hope this bitch don't think that I'mma have faith in her (No-no)
Bitch screamed when the dick was halfway in her

[Verse 2]
When the dick was halfway in her
Damn, you ain't dead yet? I'm amazed, nigga
Guess what? I'm comin' back with that gauge, nigga
Leather face, but I’m feeling like suede nigga
Got you dizzy, turning over in your grave, nigga
I could shoot this bitch and still drive straight, nigga
Bap, bap, bap, bap, I'm irate, nigga
5'5" stuntin' like I'm 5'8", nigga (What?)
Bumbu out the glass, no chase, nigga (Bumbu)
Only smoke on gas, no brakes, nigga
No brakes, road rage, my new money gonna die of old age
When they shoot, we don't race, we gon' need our own space
Need a piece of that pie, we gon' need it homemade
I be comin' home late, bad bitch, long face
She do every single thing but rub me the wrong way
'96 Dom P, I have that with Corn Flakes
And I never been intrigued by the patterns on snakes
You could dump a dead body, man, I think I know a place
She gon' suck the prototype then swallow all the proteges, nigga

[Chorus 2]
Lookin' like a open safe, nigga
We in this bitch, lookin' like Miss Oprah's safe, nigga (We're safe)
My homie caught a whole case (Whole case)
Celebratin' like he got a cold case, nigga (Oh!)
Whew, wait, nigga
Had to take a smoke break, nigga
A smoke break, nigga

[Verse 3]
I stick her hands in the fan blades, nigga
That's when she told me where her man stayed, nigga
I ran up in that bitch on a rampage, nigga
In the morning, brains in the pancakes, nigga
My bitch classy and she keep her classmates with her
Your bitch ashy and she keep a ashtray with her
Had to do it one time for my skate niggas
Skate up on you, blam-blam, skate away, nigga
Kick push, that means grind and get paid, nigga
These pay cuts bleed through the Band-Aid, nigga
So walk it like you talk it, sashay, nigga
Skate up on you, blam-blam
Okay nigga, I just left José nigga, I just left José, nigga
Federales on my ass, fuckin' had a boat chase, nigga
They didn't see no face, nigga
Your bitch spent the whole day with us
If she open her fuckin' mouth, knock all the white out, no racism
That's cold, homies, pump that bass, nigga
And sometimes we close the safe, nigga
But there ain't no code to break, niggas
I capitalize off my own mistakes, you lowercase, nigga
Your bitch cut her legs when they was on my shoulder blades, nigga
Don't hate (Don't hate) call an ace, an ace, nigga
Got Mack with me up in this bitch and a MAC just in case, nigga
I'm a Scarface, nigga, fuck your human race, nigga
I'm on base, nigga, yeah Lil Tunechi safe, nigga

[Chorus 3]
Uh, lookin' like an open safe, nigga
We in this bih lookin' like an open safe, nigga
Ya, uh, lookin' like an open safe, nigga
We in this bih lookin' like an open safe, nigga
Your ho smilin' in my face, nigga
She outta line, she out of place, nigga
I hope that they gon' think that I'ma have faith in her (No-no)
Bitch screamed when the dick was halfway in her
