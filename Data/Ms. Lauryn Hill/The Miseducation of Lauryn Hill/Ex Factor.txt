[Intro]
Yo, y-yo, yo, y-yo
Yo, uh, yo, y-yo, yo, y-yo

[Verse 1]
It could all be so simple (Ba-ba-ba-baby, baby, baby)
But you'd rather make it hard (Huh, uh)
Loving you is like a battle (It's like a battle)
And we both end up with scars

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me who I have to be (Who I have to be)
To get some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me (More than me)
And no one ever will (No one ever will, yeah)

[Verse 2]
Is this just a silly game (Silly game)
That forces you to act this way? (To act this way)
Forces you to scream my name
Then pretend that you can't stay (Yeah)

[Pre-Chorus]
Tell me, who I have to be (I know what we gotta do)
To get some reciprocity
See, no one loves you more than me
And no one ever will

[Chorus]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (It ain't working, no), it ain't working
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, this is crazy (Oh, this is crazy, uh-huh)

[Verse 3]
I keep letting you back in (You back in)
How can I explain myself? (I don't understand why)
As painful as this thing has been
I just can't be with no one else

[Pre-Chorus]
See I know what we've got to do (Yeah)
You let go (You let go), and I'll let go too (And I'll let go)
Cause no one's hurt me more than you (No one's hurt me more than you)
And no one ever will

[Chorus]
No matter how I think we grow
You always seem to let me know
It ain't working (It ain't working), it ain't working (It ain't working)
And when I try to walk away
You'd hurt yourself to make me stay
This is crazy, (This is crazy) Oh, this is crazy (This is crazy)

[Breakdown]

I know you care for me
(There) There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
(Cry) Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
(Give) Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?
(Care) Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
(There) There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
(Cry) Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
(Give) Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?
(Care) Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
(There) There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me

You said you'd die for me
(Give) Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?
(Care) Care for me, care for me
You said you'd care for me
(There) There for me, there for me
Said you'd be there for me
(Cry) Give to me, give to me
Why won't you live for me?
(Give) Cry for me, cry for me
You said you'd die for me
(Care) Where?
(There) Where?
(Cry) Where were you
(Give) When I needed you?
(Care, there, cry, give)

[Guitar Solo]

(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) Where were you
(Da, da, da, d-da, d-da) When I needed you?
