[Intro]
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Verse 1: Lauryn Hill]
As I look at what I've done
The type of life that I've lived
How many things I pray the father will forgive
One situation involved a young man
He was the ocean and I was the sand
He stole my heart like a thief in the night
Dulled my senses and blurried my sight
And I used to love him

[Chorus]
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Verse 2: Mary J. Blige & Lauryn Hill]
I chose the road of passion and pain (passion and pain)
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain
Gave up my power ceased being queen
Addicted to love like the drug of a fiend
See, torn and confused wasted and used
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated
For something to happen that just wasn't fated
Thought what I wanted was something I needed
When momma said no I just should have heeded
Misled I bled 'till the poison was gone
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn

[Chorus]
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Verse 3: Lauryn Hill & Mary J. Blige]
Father you saved me and you showed me that life
Was much more than being some foolish man's wife
Showed me that love was respect and devotion
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans
See, my soul was weary but now it's replenished
Content because that part of my life is finished
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye
Is one of a man who's lost treasures untold
But my heart is gold I took back my soul
And totally let my creator control
The life which was his, the life which was his to begin with

[Chorus]
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
Now I don't

[Outro]
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
I used to love him but now I don't
See, I used to love him
