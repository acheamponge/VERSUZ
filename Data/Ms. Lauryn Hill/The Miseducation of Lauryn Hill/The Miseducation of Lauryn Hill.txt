[Verse 1]
My world it moves so fast today
The past it seems so far away
And life squeezes so tight that I can't breathe
And every time I try to be, what someone else has thought of me
So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve

[Chorus]
But deep in my heart, the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny

[Verse 2]
I look at my environment
And wonder where the fire went
What happened to everything we used to be
I hear so many cry for help
Searching outside of themselves
Now I know that His strength is within me

[Chorus]
And deep in my heart, the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny

And deep in my heart...
And deep in my heart, the answer it was in me
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny
