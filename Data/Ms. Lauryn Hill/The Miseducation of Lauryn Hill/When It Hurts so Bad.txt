[Chorus]
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)
(When it hurts so bad)
(When it hurts so bad)

[Verse 1]
I loved real, real hard once
But the love wasn't returned
Found out the man I'd die for
He wasn't even concerned
I tried, and I tried, and I tried
To keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)
I cried, and I cried, and I cried
But I couldn't make it right

[Chorus 2]
But I, I loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
Then you'd understand
That what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)
(if you don't catch it)
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (if you just let it)
If you just let it (if you just let it)

[Verse 2]
See, I thought this feeling
It was all that I had
But how could this be love
And make me feel so bad? (gave up my power)
Gave up my power
I existed for you
But who-ever knew
The voo-doo you'd do

[Chorus 2]
But I, I loved the young man
And if you ever been in love
Then you'd understand
That what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)
(if you don't catch it)
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (if you just let it)
If you just let it (if you just let it)

See what you want might make you cry
What you need might pass you by
If you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)
(if you don't catch it)
And what you need ironically
Will turn out what you want to be
If you just let it (if you just let it)
If you just let it (if you just let it)

[Chorus]
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)
(When it hurts so bad)
(When it hurts so bad)

When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)
(When it hurts so bad)
(When it hurts so bad)

When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)
So bad (when it hurts so bad)
(When it hurts so bad)
(When it hurts so bad)

[Skit: Teacher]
You ain't said nothin'
Why you ain't say somethin' to me?
(Boy 1)
I feel like love right now is like confusion
It's like people think they love somebody
When they don't really love somebody
Like I thought I was in love with this girl but I really wasn't
It's like now, I don't feel about her
(Laughter)
[Teacher]
Ok. Alright
You think that TV and music have somethin' to do with
Why people are always confused about love?
(Girl 1)
(Yes!)
Why?
(Cause today we listen to a lot of TV a lot of music
And it sounds nice but it may not always be right for you)
We need to put you on a bullhorn
Let you ride around Newark
