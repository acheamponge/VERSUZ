[Intro: Nicki Minaj]
Yo
Man, man
Uh

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap (Mmm)
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Man I been did that, man I been popped off
And if she ain't trying to give it up she get dropped off
Let me bust that U-ie, bitch, bust that open
Might spend a couple thou' just to bust that open
Rip it off, no joking, like your name Hulk Hogan
Niggas move weight in the South, but live in Hoboken
Bitch, I spit that crack, like I'm in that trap
So if you need a hit, then I'm with that bat (Bow!)

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj & 2 Chainz]
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing (Tru!)
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap (Yeah)
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap (2 Chainz!)

[Verse 2: 2 Chainz]
Okay now Nicki, Nicki, Nicki, put it in your kidney
Got a new LS 450, ain't no keys in this do-hicky
If I weren't rapping, I'd be trapping
If I weren't trapping, I'd be pimping
If I weren't pimping, I'd be getting it, period
I don't smoke no bobby, but my denim be from ricky
Got your girl on molly and we smokin' loud and drinkin'
Got my top back so you can see what I been thinkin'
If you know me then you know I've been thinking Franklin
Money, thousands, True Religion trousers (Tell 'em!)
Got a private home, started from them public houses (Damn)
Hair weave killer, causing her arousal (Tru)
Audi A8, told them "outtie 5000," uh!

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Damn, damn, what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch
I don't know man, I'm shittin' on your whole life
Damn, damn, what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch
I don't know man, I'm shittin' on your whole life

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Man I'm out in Texas, man, I'm out in A-town
Then I'm up in Chi-town or Miami shuttin' it down
It's that New Orleans, it's LA or The Bay
It's New York, Philly, and the whole DMV
I'm a Detroit Player, man it's North-South Cack
Ohio, Pittsburgh, got St. Louis on deck
It's Delaware, Connecticut, it's New Jersey got hella bricks
It's Queens, Brooklyn, and yeah, they wildin'
Bronx, Harlem, and Staten Island

[Chorus: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't shit and they ain't sayin' nothing
A hundred motherfuckers can't tell me nothing
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap
I beez in the trap, bee beez in the trap

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Damn, damn, what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch
I don't know man, I'm shittin' on your whole life
Damn, damn, what they say about me?
I don't know man, fuck is on your biscuit
If I get hit, swinging on a big bitch
I don't know man, I'm shittin' on your whole life
