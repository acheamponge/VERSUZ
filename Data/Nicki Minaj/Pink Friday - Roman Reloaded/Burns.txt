[Verse 1]
You shoulda left the other day
You let me beg for you to stay
This is a sickening joke that you play with my emotions
And so, I pray you burn in hell, and you never find the ocean

[Chorus]
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep, and you choke on every lie you told
And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow

[Verse 2]
You piece of shit, you broke me down
Thought you said you, would hold me down
But I can see it in your eyes that you're blinded by the flashing lights
And you's a stupid muthafucker for letting this thing pass you by

[Chorus]
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope your fire, fire burns, baby
I hope you lay down in your sleep, and you choke on every lie you told
And when you’re reaching out for me, you’ll see you reap everything you sow

[Outro]
(Burn, burn, burn...)
