[Verse 1]
I can be selfish
Yeah, so impatient
Sometimes, I feel like Marilyn Monroe
I’m insecure
Yeah, I make mistakes
Sometimes, I feel like I’m at the end of the road

[Pre-Chorus]
I can get low, I can get low
Don’t know which way is up
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

[Chorus]
Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

[Verse 2]
It's like all the good things
They fall apart, like
Like Marilyn Monroe
Truth is, we mess up 'til we get it right
I don’t wanna end up losing my soul

[Pre-Chorus]
I can get low, I can get low
Don’t know which way is up
Yeah, I can get high, I can get high
Like I could never come down

[Chorus]
Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt

[Bridge]
Take me or leave me
I’ll never be perfect
Believe me, I’m worth it
So, take me or leave me (take me or leave me)
So, take me or leave me (take me or leave me)

[Chorus]
Call it a curse
Or just call me blessed
If you can’t handle my worst
You ain’t getting my best
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt
Is this how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt?
Must be how Marilyn Monroe felt, felt, felt, felt
