[Verse 1]
I used to think that we’d run away
One lovely pretty summer day
I remember when you would say
We'd be okay, come what may
I never knew you would lie to me
Took everything from inside of me
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

[Verse 2]
I used to think that we’d reunite
I’d be your wife in the real life
I thought that you’d come back for me
And you would take me away
I never knew only as a teen
You’d reappear only in my dream
Your silhouette in the doorway
But before you walk away

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

[Bridge]
This is my last cry
Is this the only way?
This is my own prison
I’m frozen in time, in time, in time

[Chorus]
Don't say goodbye, look in my eyes
So that I always will remember
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever
I’ll be over here, you’ll be over there
I’ma shed a tear, but I really don’t care
Frozen in time, always be mine
Baby boy, you’ll be young forever

[Outro]
You’ll always be mine (yeah, baby)
Frozen in time
Young forever (young forever)
