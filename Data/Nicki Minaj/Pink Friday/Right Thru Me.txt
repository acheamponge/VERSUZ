[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?

[Verse 1]
You let me win, you let me ride
You let me rock, you let me slide
And when they lookin', you let me hide
Defend my honor, protect my pride
The good advice I always hated
But lookin' back, it made me greater
You always told me forget the haters
Just get my money, just get my weight up
Know when I'm lyin', know when I'm cryin'
It's like you got it down to a science
Why am I tryin'? Know you ain't buyin'
I tried to fight it back with defiance
You make me laugh, you make me hoarse
From yellin' at you and gettin' at you
Pickin up dishes, throwin' 'em at you
Why are you speakin' when no one asked you?

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you?

[Verse 2]
What are we doin'? Could you see through me?
'Cause you say, "Nicki," and I say, "Who, me?"
And you say, "No, you," and I say, "Screw you"
Then you start dressin' and you start leavin'
And I start cryin' and I start screamin'
The heavy breathin', but what's the reason?
Always get the reaction you wanted
I'm actually frontin', I'm askin' you somethin', yo
Answer this question, class is in session
Tired of lettin' passive-aggression
Control my mind, capture my soul
Okay, you're right, just let it go
Okay, you got it, it's in the can
Before I played it, you knew my hand
You could turn a free throw to a goal
Nigga got the peephole to my soul

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you? (Do that)
How do you?

[Bridge]
Stop (Ooh)
Stop (Ooh)
Won't you just stop lookin' through me? 'Cause I can't take it
No, I can't take it (You see right)

[Chorus]
You see right through me
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you do that shit?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
How do you?
You see right through me
You see right through me, baby
You see right through me (Do that shit)
You see right through me (How do you do that shit?)
How do you do that? How do you do that?
How do you do that? How do you do that?
Baby
