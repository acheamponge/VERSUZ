[Verse 1]
Yo, I had to reinvent, I put the V in-vent
I put the heat in vents, man, I've been competing since
I look beyond what people saying, and I see intent
Then I just sit back and decipher what they really meant
Cherish these nights, cherish these people
Life is a movie, but there'll never be a sequel
And I'm good with that as long as I'm peaceful
As long as seven years from now I'm taking my daughter to preschool
Cherish these days, man, do they go quick
Just yesterday, I swear it was 'o-six
Ten years ago, that's when you proposed
I looked down, "Yes, I suppose"

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 2]
I lost my little cousin, to a senseless act of violence
His sister said he wanted to stay with me, but I didn't invite him
Why didn't he ask, or am I just buggin'?
Cause since I got fame, they don't act the same
Even though they know that I love 'em
Family ties, broken before me
Niggas trying to kill him, he ain't even call me
And that's the reflection of me, yes, I get it, I get it was all me
I pop a pill and remember the look in his eyes
The last day he saw me

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
I feel one minute, yeah, we got it then it's gone
While we keep waiting for a moment to live for
So can't nobody ever tell me that I'm wrong
Cause I'ma ride out with you, still the night is young
And we keep going, we go
(We go, we go) We wake back up and do it all again
(We know, we know) Say fuck the world, we riding 'til the end
When all is said and done, look what we've become
I just want you to know that I did it for you

[Verse 3]
Let me make this clear, I'm not difficult, I'm just 'bout my business
I'm not into fake industry parties, and fake agendas
Rock with people for how they make me feel, not what they give me
Even the ones that hurt me the most, I still show forgiveness
I love my mother more than life itself and that's a fact
I'd give it all if somehow I could just rekindle that
She never understands why I'm so overprotective
The more I work, the more I feel like somehow they're neglected
I want 'Caiah to go to college, just to say "We did it!"
My child with Aaron, would've been sixteen any minute
So in some ways I feel like 'Caiah is the both of them
It's like he's 'Caiah's little angel, looking over him
And I know Jelani will always love me, and I'll always love him
And I'm just his little sister, not Nicki Minaj when I'm around him
Gee, we did it, let's leave this imprint
Just finished writing, this is The Pinkprint

[Chorus]
All things go, all things go
All things go, all things go
