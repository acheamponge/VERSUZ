[Intro: Meek Mill]
You hear that right there?
That sound like, but that 300 thousand nigga
I'm triple OG in my hood
These hoes call me big daddy

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Your bitch call me big daddy
Tell that bitch that I'm big daddy
When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch
Nigga I go and get the big daddy
Pick a bitch up in the big daddy
Big face Rollie that's a big daddy
Got your bitch calling me big daddy
When I pull up all the hoes like big daddy
Nigga I'm big daddy

[Verse 1: Meek Mill]
Standin' on the corner in some shit that look like I payed like a million for
Blowin' the money I heard that they askin' around town what he really worth
Most of these niggas be really broke
I went the Hardaway boy had a penny first
Now these bitches gon' get this work
I tell her keep on them heels and that mini skirt
She Google my net worth, lookin' like "what is his neck worth?"
My shooters, they shoot at your head, like the rim just to see if the net work
I land in Miami then fly out to Cali with some of my best work
You niggas so lame that my bitches won't fuck unless you cut a check first

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Your bitch call me big daddy
Tell that bitch that I'm big daddy
When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch
Nigga I go and get the big daddy
Pick a bitch up in the big daddy
Big face Rollie that's a big daddy
Got your bitch calling me big daddy
When I pull up all the hoes like big daddy
Nigga I'm big daddy

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Pulled up in something that look like a million nigga put me up on
Ain't gotta sell it, but he say the pussy a drug that he re-up on
Spur of the moment, I ball like Ginóbili, you bitches get D'ed up on
You mad at me? Go get mad at your nigga 'fore I put my sneakers on
He copped me this wrist game, now it's just us at the Knicks game
I might have to take him on tour just to fuck in Australia, Brisbane
Your time is ticking, you bitches will be around shorter than Vine vids
You watch your mouth or my niggas will shoot up the club like what Shyne did

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Your bitch call me big daddy
Tell that bitch that I'm big daddy
When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch
Nigga I go and get the big daddy
Pick a bitch up in the big daddy
Big face Rollie that's a big daddy
Got your bitch calling me big daddy
When I pull up all the hoes like big daddy
Nigga I'm big daddy

[Verse 3: Nicki Minaj]
Bitches ain't stupid, you bitches ain't stupid
You bitches ain't stupid, is you?
Front like she tough but that bitch keep on crying
Get this bitch a tissue
For what it's worth when I took him I could tell he would never miss you
I ain't even wanna diss you, but tell me what is this bitch issue?

[Bridge: Nicki Minaj]
Still on top, pretty bitch gang
Pussy still tight, pistol still bang
Yo nigga call me big mama
Let him eat the pussy then I dip on him

[Chorus: Meek Mill]
Your bitch call me big daddy
Tell that bitch that I'm big daddy
When I hit the lot I don't get the little bitch
Nigga I go and get the big daddy
Pick a bitch up in the big daddy
Big face Rollie that's a big daddy
Got your bitch calling me big daddy
When I pull up all the hoes like big daddy
Nigga I'm big daddy
