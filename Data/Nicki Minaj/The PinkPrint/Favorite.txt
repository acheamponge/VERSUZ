[Intro: Jeremih]
I don't want no drama
I just wanna be your diamond, babe
Guaranteed to be a problem
Every time I get around you, babe
I just want you to need me
You might really wanna try me, babe
All I know I want a rider
All I know I want a rider babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe, ah yeah

[Verse 1: Nicki Minaj]
Yo, I just wanna be ya rider, you should pull up in that Spyder
You should let me hit the mic, and I ain't talking about the fighter
Get it lit without a lighter, let's pull an all-nighter
Tell me-tell me what you need, got the weed, I'm a bad lil' bitch and I never indict her
Get locked, I'ma write ya, you on the road? I'ma Skype ya
I-I-I-I-I don't wanna hype ya, but you a lucky nigga if my mean ass like ya
You ain't never have a bitch understand you, most of them wanna use you when they ran through
I just wanna be somebody that can add to, your wife, be a friend, be a teacher and a fan too
I just wanna listen, when you leave I say, "Damn, I fucking miss him"
I just wanna be your vixen, give you something real wet to put your lips in
I wanna be the only one that can check you, and still respect you
Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
Won't you let me be your favorite?

[Verse 2: Nicki Minaj]
Ayo, I just wanna be your first go-to, do you like a real one supposed to, livin' bi-coastal
Scoop me in the truck, late-night on a humble
Meet me out in Queens, where the city want a sundown
You could put your gun down, you could have fun now
You could tell your niggas that you won now, one down
Run through the clubs with the baddest, bitches is the maddest, nothin' else matters (Matters)
And they say, Birkin where the bag is, got a lot of bags, but we never got baggage
Winter Wonderland on my hands, call me Alice, balance
I'ma have you coming in my palace
London, Tokyo, Paris, let me update your status
'Cause it's you I would change for, you always make sure

[Chorus: Jeremih]
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
Won't you let me be your favorite?

[Outro: Nicki Minaj, Jeremih]
You should already know
You should already know
You should already know
You should already know
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe
You know that you need a rider
You know that you need a rider, babe, ah yeah
I just wanna be your favorite
I just wanna be your favorite
You should already know, you should already know
I just wanna be your favorite
You should already know, you should already know
Won't you let me be your favorite? (Oh, baby)
You know that you need a rider, rider, rider, rider, rider, rider
Oh, oh, oh
You know that you need a rider, rider, rider, ri-i-ider
Won't you let me be your favorite?
You know that you need a rider, rider, rider, rider, rider, rider
Oh, oh, oh
You know that you need a rider, rider, rider, ri-i-ider
